The Mume Reader
================================

The Mume Reader ("Mume" for short) project is aimed to create
a user friendly reading environment. Although there are many
opensource document viewers already exist, they rarely provid
complete functions such as annotation, reading history etc.

Some proprietory document viewer that have a pretty good usability
(e.g. Adobe Reader, Foxit Reader), but they usually dose not support
opensource OS like Linux, or provide a port version that with most
functionality stripped.

Mume is intended to support multi platform, currently mainly
running on Ubuntu and Windows, and should be easily port to other
Linux distributions. it currently just support PDF document, but
conside to support other formats in the future.
